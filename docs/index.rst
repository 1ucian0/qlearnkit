Qlearnkit: a python toolkit for Quantum Machine Learning
=========================================================
Welcome to the documentation page for ``qleanrkit``.

``Qlearnkit`` is a python library implementing machine-learning algorithms and models for a
gated quantum computer, mainly developed for academic purposes at
Institute EURECOM. If you find any issues, please report it at the
`GitHub page <https://github.com/mspronesti/qlearnkit>`_.

Requirements
------------
The following package is required for this to work:
 * Qiskit
 * Scikit-learn

Optionally, it also requires:
 * Pennylane
 * Pytorch

Dependencies
------------
The same dependencies needed for Qiskit and Scikit-learn are also needed for this package to
work.

Usage
-----
More info on how to work with the qlearnkit is explained thoroughly in
the rest of the documentation.
